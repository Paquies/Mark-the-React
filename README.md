## Introduction

Mark the React is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive guide for setting up and working with React and MDX. This guide covers various aspects of using React and MDX together, including setting up the project, configuring MDX, writing MDX content, styling MDX components, and providing practical examples.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. React allows developers to create reusable UI components.
- **MDX**: A format that allows you to write JSX directly within markdown documents. This combination enables the use of React components within markdown files, making documentation interactive and dynamic.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler used to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.
- **PrismJS**: A lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter used for highlighting code blocks.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Components**: Reusable React components used throughout the project.
- **MDX Files**: Markdown files with embedded JSX for creating interactive documentation.
- **Styles**: Custom styles written in SCSS and CSS for styling the application.
- **Configuration**: Webpack and Babel configurations for handling MDX files and other assets.
