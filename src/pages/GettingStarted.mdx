### Introduction to React and MDX

<br />
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you can create reusable UI components. It allows developers to build web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown for JSX) is a format that lets you seamlessly write [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) within markdown documents. This combination is powerful because it allows you to use React components directly in your markdown files, making your documentation interactive and dynamic.

Using React and MDX together is useful for creating interactive documentation, tutorials, and blogs where you can demonstrate live code examples and provide a richer learning experience.

In this guide, we will cover the following topics:

1. Setting up a React project
2. Understanding JSX
3. Components and Props
4. State and Lifecycle
5. Handling Events
6. Conditional Rendering
7. Lists and Keys
8. Forms
9. Lifting State Up
10. Composition vs Inheritance
11. Thinking in React
