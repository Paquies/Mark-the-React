# Getting Started with React
# Introduction 

This is a guide to help you get started with the [**React**](https://reactjs.org) library. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A code editor like VSCode

## Installation

To install React, you can use the following command:

<CopyableCode>
    npm install -g create-react-app
</CopyableCode>

This will create a new React app in a folder called `my-app`. You can replace `my-app` with the name of your app.

```python
cd my-app   # Change directory to the app folder
```

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in the browser.
