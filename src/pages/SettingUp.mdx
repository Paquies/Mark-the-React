<h1 className='titleMdx'>Setting Up a React Project with MDX</h1>

<br/>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a basic understanding of React, Node.js, and Markdown. These are essential for setting up and working with a React project that includes MDX.

<br/>

## Installing Node.js and npm

To work with React, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

<br/>

## Creating a React Project

To create a new React project, you can use the <span className='highlight'>create-react-app</span> tool. Run the following command in your terminal:

<br/>

<CopyableCode language="bash">
    {`npx create-react-app my-app`}
</CopyableCode>

This command creates a new React project called <span className='highlight'>my-app</span> in the current directory. You can replace <span className='highlight'>my-app</span> with the name of your choice.

<br/>

## Adding MDX Support

To add MDX support to your React project, you need to install the <span className='highlight'>{`@mdx-js/react`}</span> package. Run the following command in your project directory:

<br/>

<CopyableCode language="bash">
    {`npm install @mdx-js/react`}
</CopyableCode>

Next, you need to configure your project to use MDX. Create a file called <span className='highlight'>{`mdx-provider.js`}</span> in your <span className='highlight'>src</span> directory with the following content:

<br/>

<CopyableCode language="jsx">
{`
    import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react';
    import React from 'react';

    const components = {
        // Add custom components here
    };

    const MdxProvider = ({ children }) => (
        <MDXProvider components={components}>
            {children}
        </MDXProvider>
    );

    export default MdxProvider;`}
</CopyableCode>

Then, wrap your application with the <span className='highlight'>{`MdxProvider`}</span> component. Modify your <span className='highlight'>{`src/index.js`}</span> file as follows:

<br/>

<CopyableCode language="jsx">
{`  import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';
    import MdxProvider from './mdx-provider';

    ReactDOM.render(
        <MdxProvider>
            <App />
        </MdxProvider>,
        document.getElementById('root')
    );
`}
</CopyableCode>

<br/>

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

<br/>

<CopyableCode language="bash">
    {`npm start`}
</CopyableCode>

This command starts the development server and opens your React application in the browser. You can now view and interact with your React project.

<br/>

## Conclusion

In this guide, we covered the steps to set up a new React project using <span className='highlight'>create-react-app</span> and add MDX support. You can now start building your React applications with MDX and explore the world of React development.

Happy coding!
