## Installation

To install React, you can use the following command:

<br/>

<CopyableCode>
    npm install -g create-react-app
</CopyableCode>

This command installs the <span className='highlight'>create-react-app</span> package globally on your machine. You can then use it to create new React projects.

## Creating a New React Project

To create a new React project, run the following command:

<br/>

<CopyableCode>
    npx create-react-app my-app
</CopyableCode>

This command creates a new React project called <span className='highlight'>my-app</span> in the current directory. You can replace <span className='highlight'>my-app</span> with the name of your choice.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

<br/>

<CopyableCode>
    npm start
</CopyableCode>

This command starts the development server and opens your React application in the browser. You can now view and interact with your React project.
