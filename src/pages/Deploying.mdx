<br/>

Deploying your React-MDX project involves a few key steps to ensure that your application is optimized and accessible to your users. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Building for Production

To build your React-MDX project for production, you need to optimize your app. This involves minifying your code, optimizing images, and ensuring that your app runs efficiently.

1. **Run the build command**: In your project directory, run the following command to create an optimized production build:
    
<CopyableCode language='bash'>
    {`npm run build`}
</CopyableCode>

    This will create a <span className='highlight'>build</span> folder with all the optimized files.

2. **Verify the build**: You can verify the build by running a local server to serve the files from the `build` folder:

<CopyableCode language='bash'>
    {`npx serve -s build`}
</CopyableCode>

    This will start a local server at <span className='highlight'>{`http://localhost:5000`}</span> where you can check your production build.

> **Warning**: Make sure to test your production build thoroughly before deploying.
